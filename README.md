# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms based on a dataset containing 290(after data preprocessing) patient records with 14 medical attributes. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis of heart disease, enabling timely medical intervention.

Project Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the risk of heart disease ranging from 0 to 4 based on the severity of coronary artery blockage. 
The dataset used can be found below

The following dataset consists of 920 instances and 14 attributes.

Key Features:
1) Data Preprocessing: Data normalization and feature selection to optimize model performance.
2) Machine Learning Models: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree

3) Dataset
The dataset contains 920 instances and 14 attributes, including:

Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG Results, Max Heart Rate, and others.
Each instance is labeled with a target value ranging form 0 to 4 based on the risk of heart disease.

Algorithms to be Used:
1) K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
2) Naïve Bayes
3) Decision Tree
